      <h2 class="p-name">Week One</h2>
      <p class="e-content">  I installed GitHub last year for a project and have used it a few times to
        share projects thus I am a bit familiar on how to use some features.</p> 
        My goal for this course is to make easy to read and understandable websites.
        Some websites just have an overwhelming amount of information on it,
        displayed through complicated formats or structures. Which makes it hard
        to read and understand how the website functions and where to find what
        you are looking for. Most websites organize information into many
        different categories and as such, they have a table of contents to display
        this information. </p> 
        However, for a first-time user to always refer to the
        homepage to find the table of contents to then click on a specific topic
        they were looking for, is tedious. To combat this problem, I have noticed
        that websites display the table of contents pop up on all pages. This does
        make the user experience or flow smoother. I also have realized that when
        surfing the internet or looking through websites, users have the
        expectation that the next page of information, related to the one they are
        reading, will show up next for them to access.</p> 
       <p > I think it is quite
        interesting how the human brain stores information. In the reading, As We
        May Think, Bush states that humans think through pathways. They have one
        thought that leads to another, and this is how they remember information
        stored in their minds. Whereas machines have to browse through the
        information stored in them to bring up a topic. The reading then touches
        on the idea of selection by association. This stands out to me because
        nowadays when users use search engines, they can filter their ideas by
        selecting and deselecting topics. Or even just browse through ideas to
        find something that interests them. This in a way accommodates for the way
        the human brain thinks. Because then, the user clicks on the topic that
        interests them which will then lead them to having another thought and
        they may or may not, find something on the website that corresponds to
        that next thought.</p>

        I have prior experience with html. I am familiar with the simple methods of coding html, such as 
        headings, titles and paragraphs. However, during this past weeks, the work has come off as overwhelming at 
        times but I am trying to take my time to understand the code and actually write it out so that I can understand it better. 
        I have read both the readings and from both of them, I have realised that coding websites 
        is not only about displaying information.</p> <p class="e-content"> Websites need to be functional, accessible and 
          easy on the eyes. Performance is hugely important too but this is also hugely linked to the functionality 
          of the website. The website can only perform well if it functions well. 
        Hierarchy is important, we need to distribute information in such a way that makes it easy for readers to
         read and understand. However, the way it looks is very important. Websites need to have the right background
          colours, font sizes, font types and decorative elements. It should not look overly pretty but it should not look ugly.
           It must look good enough for readers willing to stay and read its contents.</p> <p class="e-content">
        In my opinion, these two factors work together. When a site looks good, readers stay and browse through it 
        but readers also need to, unconsciously or consciously, be aware of the information hierarchy. By having 
        the main heading appear larger than the section headings, makes the reader aware that these section 
        headings are just smaller topics of the main heading. Thus, why it is important to separate information 
        into their own containers. It leans more into the information hierarchy.
        Websites also need to work well in order to be successful. The links, the buttons 
        and the functionality need to respond to the reader’s action. If none of them work, 
        the reader will immediately log off the website because they are not getting what they
         came for. The functionality part of a website works because of the html code. 
      In conclusion, the designer needs to place information into containers and then display
       these in a hierarchy while also making their code work with the aim that the functionality
        of their code will make the website perform well.

      <p class="e-content">The troubles I had with my website was the code part. 
        I forgot I had to add the normalize CSS code page to my folder and then have links for the 
        CSS scripts to the index HTML page. After, I added this scripts and links. I was able to 
        start developing my website. I can add borders, colour and boxes to my webpage by using classes but
         I am trying to figure out how to use CSS to code more complex decorative elements with html 
         functionality such as having images next to each other that are actually links to read other pages. </p>
       <p class="e-content">
        The concept of convention from the reading ties into UI and UX. In the lecture video, it can be surmised that the door had a poor design
         because users did not like how it worked. That specific door handle has the convention of pulling it to open the door. In this case, 
         this convention is completely changed because this door handle requires users to push it to open the door. Since the convention is
          different, users are unfamiliar with it and as a result, don’t like it.
      Conventions are practices that are widely accepted and used in daily life. In the reading, it is stated that when a new practice is 
      started, it shocks the audience and its medium. If others adopt this practice, then it becomes convention (Mailloux 1983: 399). In the 
      case of the door handle, more than shock. Users despise the door handle and due to this, it can’t become a convention.
       </p>
       <p class="e-content">
        With this idea applied to websites and their Ui/Ux. It is safe to assume that new practices can be started with them but as long as the 
        reader doesn’t hate it. Do not take existing conventions and change their function. However, websites need to maintain their standard 
        conventions of Ui and Ux because readers are used to certain design structures of websites.
      You can not code a paragraph to look like a heading, the paragraph’s convention is that its text is smaller than the heading to show that 
      it is giving more insight to it. If you change this convention, it doesn’t make sense and as a result, readers are going to despise it. If 
      you do want to start a new convention, don’t change its function, rather expand more on it. For example, you can change the paragraph’s 
      font, text color, background color or have the reader click on the heading to read the paragraph. In this case, the function doesn’t
       change, and readers can still understand it.
        I think it's good that we can access lectures that offer us different perspectives on the content. 
        Watching them really helps deepen my understanding of the work. It broadens your perspective and lets you looks at
         concepts or problems from different viewpoints and this really helps when it comes to problem solving.

        I looked at a previous wireframe for my website I drew out earlier and realized that it does not work or function great like
         how I initially thought it would. The ui is simple on my wireframe but the website doesn’t function properly nor smoothly. 
         It is hard to get to the next section of information because I intended to have all information sections in their own webpage
          and I realized that the reader or user will have a problem going to one section and then back to the homepage to find the next 
          section of information.
I could solve this problem by having the user click a link to the next or previous section. A lot of websites do this but, in this case, 
it doesn’t make sense to make one individual webpage for each dev blog on the website. I think a better design decision would be to group 
two or three together in one webpage. I am going to test it out and see if it works.

        Based on the readings and lectures, the revisions I need to do for my website are adding in semiotics and functionality
         such as a navigation panel on the top of the website and links to get to the top and bottom of the webpage. I also need to 
         center most of the user interface to the center of the screen, make the design clear and simple and lastly minimize the 
         number of steps to get to the next webpage. Basically, I want the process of getting to the next section to be easy to 
         perform and fast while its being performed.
        Interactivity and UI are linked to each other. If interactivity is about having a response to an action being performed 
        than UI, is the element that helps inform the user that this a

        User Experience can be said to be the experience of interacting with an item or system (Goldberg 2023 : 2). In this case, it is the 
        experience of interacting with a website. The reading explores these ideas of how design choices, like color and shapes and 
        also portrayal of the hierarchy of information affects the user. A simple design choice of using a font can comfort the 
        human eye when reading it or hurt it. Having a paragraph centered to the middle or edge affects how a user is able to read it? 
        This just shows that design choices are not only there to attract the user but to ease and convince the user to be comfortable 
        while reading the website.

    <p class="e-content">I did not get much work done in these two weeks because I was feeling sick. However, I did manage to do
      some planning for my website and some of its elements; such as how the hierarchy of information is going to look. Though, I only 
      managed to plan one and it works as follows: Main title, followed by a paragraph of information. This paragraph will have a 
      semi-transparent colourful background because then the viewer will automatically think that all the paragraphs with a background 
      are small containers of information for the main heading of the webpage. I plan to use this idea for the weekly blogs.</p>

      <p class="e-content"> Continuing my website development, I was faced with the problem of how to make links to get to
        other webpages and subsections. To combat this problem, I used anchor tags and made them look like buttons so that viewers 
        can see that they are interactable and when they click on them, it will take them to the required destination. 
       Then I decided to have another anchor tag to scroll up that lets the viewer go to the top of the webpage so that they don’t have 
       to scroll to wherever they want to go. I used this same principle to make a navigation bar but I am not sure whether it should stay
        in a fixed position like the scroll up anchor tag. </p>
          This feeds into my IxD process of information structure, content mapping and user flow. Since I decided to have all content in the
        middle of the webpage, the user flow will be directed in one direction and that is downwards. This will be convenient for the viewer
         because they will only have to look downwards to go to the next content of information. However, the user flow will also go in the 
         right direction but this is only to click on the scroll up function or to pick an anchor tag that will take them to the subsection 
         they want to read. 
       For the information structure, as stated above, all content will be situated towards the middle. Thereafter, I designed two type of
        information hierarchies and these are as follows: 1. Title of webpage, 2. Short paragraph and 3. Functions to go to required subsection
         of webpage. The other is as follows: 1. Title of subsection of webpage, 2. Paragraph with information and 2 will have a light colourful
          background. </p>
     
       The reading really touches on the nuances of UX. At first. UX is only seen as design but when you really try to understand it and 
       use it, UX becomes a topic of how effective your design is and last but not least, does it look attractive or not. But if a design 
       is effective does that mean that it has to be attractive? There is more to UX than just art and design but do these two factors 
       mostly overshadow the other factors that contribute to an effective user experience?

      <p class="e-content">What went wrong? 
        </p> <p class="e-content">
        The spacing and alignment of content in my website. I wanted everything to be centred towards the middle of the page however looking back now, the alignment is a bit off because of the padding and margin values clashing with each other.
        The font and font size. I thought that using sans serif would be easier on the eyes but it seems a bit cramped because of the misalignment of content and the font size. I tried to make it consistent but at some webpages, the headings look too big or just right. I did use the same values while coding but, on the website, the font size looks very different at different places.
        Colour palette, the colour of the text doesn’t seem to work with the cool blue and purple colour palette. I made the colour of text in dark grey but seems light against cool colour backgrounds, perhaps backgrounds should be brighter or either the text should be darker. 
       </p> I struggled with the navigation bar . At first, I wanted it to be a strip on top of webpage but then thought that it would be easier to have its position fixed and user can decide to go anywhere they want whenever they want  but the design doesn’t look right. It also breaks the convention of having navigation bars on top of webpages. Now that I look back, it doesn’t make sense because I do have a scroll to the top page that the user can press on to get to the nav bar if they want to leave webpage. 
        Things I would do differently
        Change colours to make text stand out and easy on the eyes. Make separate tags and individually align them to be centred at middle. Redesign the navigation bar by unfixing its position, make a background behind the links and use the convention of navigation bars which is that it appears on top of webpage and has a background with the website name or logo next to it. Also, I am going to try make website not look too simple, I am going to try adding some design to the backgrounds to make it look aesthetically good.

        How do the two readings relate and how do they impact your thinking about web dev as a South African  </p>
        The readings relate to each other because they both speak on the topics of geographic information. The first reading, Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information, introduces the idea that information has always had geography and that with time, devices that can transport information without significant change to its characteristics and meaning, have appeared. These devices are called immutable mobiles and due to these, information was able to be transferred and transported around easily. 
        The immutable devices made spreading information easy and as a result, more information specific to places became known to more people. These are called (im)mutable augmentations because they act as containers of information for a geographic place that people can access. Thus, these geographic distributions of info becomes a means for political contestation to occur. 
      </p>The second reading, Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results, also speaks about (im)mutable augmentations but rather calls them digital augmentations of places. This reading touches on troubling concepts such as geographic information being produced and then becomes a producer of power relations. The search engine which is designed to help users search for specific ideas, topics, concepts, etc on the internet then becomes a deciding factor in which information should be presented to whom. 
        These readings leads one to think that web development is not as simple as coding websites and apps to share and distribute information to the public. The way in which information is shared and the sources from which it comes from is very important. Many people blindly trust and follow the internet without stopping to think or question the legitimacy of the information they are reading. Due to this, it can be said that manipulating information, about a geographical place or anything else even, on the internet is very easy because people trust the internet.

         Massimo Ragnedda and Maria Laura Ruiu (2017) Social capital and the three levels of digital divide. In Ragnedda M., Muschert G. eds. (2017), Theorizing Digital Divides, Routledge, pp. 21-34.
        In their text “Social capital and the three levels of digital divide”, Ragnedda and Ruiu investigate and discuss how social capital can influence digital divide and the relation social capital has with the three levels of digital divide before pointing out digital capital stands on its own but is ultimately connected to other forms of capital. 
        “social capital is functional to the maintenance and reproduction of the existing social structure (see also Field, 2008) both offline and online.”
        Ragnedda and Ruiu begin their paper with a discussion on what social capital is before they conclude that social capital produces and reproduces inequality in the online sphere. <p>
        Social capital is likened to a credential because it allows access of resources to group members that a group has permission to use. Due to this, existing social capital of internet users can promote the existence of virtual communities that aim to produce benefits for its members. As a result, maintaining inequalities between people but in the online sphere.
        “Indeed, one of the missions of the Internet is to connect people, by creating new and reinforcing existing social networks. The Internet may also support users’ in increasing their social capital while gaining benefits in economic, personal and cultural terms. However, in order to do this, citizens are supposed not only to access to Internet, bridging the first level of digital divide, but to have particular skills (technical, social, critical, strategic and creative) and motivation in using the Internet.” <p>
        There are levels of digital divide between those who can or cannot access the internet, those who want to and don’t want to use the internet or see no purpose in using it and lastly those who want to and don’t want to invest their time in building connections with people in the online sphere or learning how to access and spread valuable information, again in the online sphere. 
        An important factor such as user’s backgrounds is mentioned in the reading because a user’s background has an influence on whether they have access to the internet, if whether they are well versed in using the internet and what information can they search for, process or even share on social media while using the internet. This all leads into how well a user can use the internet to their benefit in the social, economic or even cultural spectrum.

I was inspired to do this after seeing the coding sidebar exercise from week 6.</p>

<p class="e-content">The Road to Technocolonialism </p>
<p class="e-content">This reading touches on the concept of AI and its capabilities, benefits and also its drawbacks before stating that using AI can lead to techno colonialism. Artificial intelligence is powerful in the sense that it affects economies and power relations. It also has influence over military operations. The benefit of using artificial intelligence is that it can contribute greatly to global productivity. </p>
<p class="e-content">However, the problem begins with governments and/or countries not having the infrastructure to bring artificial intelligence into various operations. Only certain countries, like the USA and China have thoroughly developed AI and developing countries have to turn to China or USA for AI access. In turn, superpowers like China and the USA request for economic and political gain. They receive data of citizens from the developing countries and also get more geopolitical influence over them.</p>
<p class="e-content">A way to overcome this problem would be for developing countries to invest more in making their own infrastructure for AI access in their countries. If developing countries become independent, they won’t need to rely on a third party to let them access AI and its systems. They also won’t be forced to abide by political decisions of the superpowers it is reliant on. However, building up and maintaining the infrastructure for AI can take a long time and before developing countries can make their own, they have to rely on a superpower to give it to them, leaving them in a techno-colonial relationship with their superpower. A techno-colonial relationship refers to one party receiving political and economic gain and the other, technological access. </p>
<p class="e-content">This might seem as a reasonable trade but it is not. Countries are trading their citizen’s data and giving their superpower more geopolitical influence over the people from their country. This indirectly gives the superpower a form of control over the developing country, they make them reliant on them and have an opportunity to exploit this relationship, by making them comply with the political decisions they enforce irrespective of it being ethically correct or not.</p>

      <p class="e-content">Website development:</p>
      <p class="e-content">The benefits of responsive design is that it makes interaction with the website easy for the user/reader. When users interact with a website, they need to make decisions and these decisions need to be expressed clearly on the website’s interface (Geyser 2023). Based on this, it is safe to deduce that this is where responsive design occurs. Points of interaction need to be designed in a way “that leads and interests your user” (Geyser 2023), this is what responsive design is. </p>
      <p class="e-content">But responsive design can be challenging. Since it is supposed to make interaction easier and interesting, is it supposed to be creative? Having a creative design does make users interested but do users prefer to interact with designs they are used to or are they open to seeing and interacting with new designs?</p>
      <p class="e-content">In my website, while designing my wireframes. I decided to add anchor tags to a word from my text that gives context to what the webpage is so that when users are reading the paragraph, they can choose to click on the word, if they want to read more about that topic. This, in a way, contributes to the responsive design element of my website. It makes user flow smoothly instead of writing a full paragraph explaining something and then adding buttons and anchor tags for users to click on afterwards. It also makes interaction easier, faster and more comprehendible because users can just read that sentence and then click on certain words instead of having to refer back to the top paragraph and then deciding from a lot of buttons which to read next.</p>
      <p class="e-content">How we code matters and close reading:</p>
      <p class="e-content">Programming is always regarded as being neutral. It is regarded as just being a bunch of letters and numbers that a programmer can put into a software program and it will run a function. This is true and not true at the same time. Words mean something and thus, programming languages do have meaning (Geyser 2023). They output something, words and numbers or they run an operation. </p>
      <p class="e-content">Programming has become such an important factor in running daily operations. It has made countless programs and software that has become essential for technology use. While it has proved to have many benefits and advantages, there are still drawbacks in this industry. </p>
      <p class="e-content">One of the major drawbacks is how it is being used in global politics. In a close reading of Algorithmic Colonization of Africa, Abeba Birhane talks about the algorithmic colonization in Africa and how political, economic and ideological domination occurs with a technological justification. </p>
      <p class="e-content">“Common to both traditional and algorithmic colonialism is the desire to dominate, monitor, and influence social, political, and cultural discourse through the control of core communication and infrastructure mediums”</p>
      <p class="e-content">Western technology has grown and developed their AI technology. Using this, they have developed much of their operations with AI and introduced it into the South. This has been done to the point that daily operations cannot be performed without the integration of AI. This has resulted in making workflow more efficient but the dependence of technological infrastructures on Western powers leaves the South at a disadvantage. Not only that but through social communication mediums, the people of the South are at risk of getting influencing into agreeing with any political, social and cultural discourse that western powers expose them to. </p>

      <p class="e-content">Web development</p>
      <p class="e-content">I spent this week adding html and css to my webpages. After finishing my wireframes, I began to code my website. I did not start investigating APIs because this week has just been about making my website and thinking about the interface, ui and ux of my website and how to make it interesting but also understandable for the user. </p>
      <p class="e-content">Reflection</p>
      <p class="e-content">The reading introduces the problem of AI systems, databases, algorithms and technology being created with a strict set of rules or data that are based on values, norms and assumptions from society and/or socio-political factors. When these systems are designed, they are designed to remain in that state. In other words, their design is not accommodating towards change. It is static and rigid. When it encounters something outside of its learning data, it deems it as something different, possibly risky, because it doesn’t conform to its data. </p>
      <p class="e-content">The Design Justice Network seems to be a good solution against this problem. By having design aimed not only towards efficiency but also towards a change or in better words, flexible values and practices. AI systems can better accommodate for any change if their learning data or systems in place are always learning and comprehending these values, practices and pedagogies.  </p>

      <p class="e-content">Website development</p>
      <p class="e-content">This week there has been a lot of power outages by where I live so there hasn’t been enough time to work on my website. The work I have done is code CSS elements on the webpages, code JavaScript for my navigation bar, implementing media queries and work on my theory for the design section. </p>

      <p class="e-content">In Digital Divide Widens by  Maria Tataki & Dimitris Glynos, the divide between the privileged digital sector and the underpriveldged is highlighted. This divide has always been present but its ultimately, the pandemic has brought everyone’s awareness to this. Children from underprivileged homes were unable to continue their education when teaching was being conducted online and workers from the same background were unable to continue working. </p>
      <p class="e-content">Why? Why does this digital divide exist? Is it because of the lack of infrastructure, that people are unable to get internet access or is it because of the lack of economic growth that people are unable to buy laptops and/or other electronic devices, data bundles or Wi-Fi routers? </p>
      <p class="e-content">The privileged have internet access and electronic devices to use the internet on a daily basis. During the pandemic, they were able to work from home or continue learning when teaching was being conducted online. Is it because they have enough money to buy the latest and supported electronic devices to use? Or is it because they have enough money to access resources, such as internet access or Wi-Fi or even mobile data from what infrastructure there is present in that country? </p>
      <p class="e-content">This means that along with the problem of the infrastructure needing to be further developed, the other problem is that access to this infrastructure needs to be easily available/accessible and the cost of accessing them, needs to be low enough to accommodate people from underprivileged homes.</p>
      <p class="e-content"> But if governments rely on another country to provide these resources to their country then wouldn’t the cost to buy these, also be high? Because the infrastructure is being bought from another country? Or do countries that lend their resources to others, partake and contribute to techno colonialism and keep cost prices low so that mostly everyone has internet access, even underprivileged households but the price everyone pays is that their data is being collected and used by a third party?</p>
      <p class="e-content">I don’t have sufficient evidence to back up claims but these are merely just questions I often ask myself when it comes to this topic that I wish to research further in more detail. </p>
