          Building a website takes a lot of time. You first need to design
          <a class="links" href="#wireframes"> wireframes</a>
          for how it is going to look, then you need to add
          <a class="links" href="#styleGuide"> visual elements</a> such as
          colour, font, etc to make the website look good, decide on what
          <a class="links" href="#ui+ux">UI and UX </a> interactions should be
          present in the website and then finally you are almost done.

          The colours I used for assignment 1 were blue, purple, white, grey and
          black. They were cool and calming colours that I wanted to use to
          produce a calming effect on the user. However, for this, assignment 3,
          I used warm colours such Vivid Tangerine (#F3958B), Linen (#FAEEDF),
          Bone (#EBD7C5), Pastel Blue (#A7D1D0) and Nickel (#737373). I found
          this colour scheme on the website, www.schemecolor.com.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I changed the colour scheme because I found that brighter warm colours
          gives off a playful mood and feeling to the website. It makes the
          website look creative, stylish and welcoming. The previous colours
          made the website look dull and serious. It ended up looking
          non-friendly and unapproachable. With this new colours, the website
          looks user friendly and evokes a pleasant mood for the user.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          Last assignment I used one font throughout the website to make the
          content look easy and accessible to read. However, this time, I
          experimented with many fonts and ended up using more than one type
          throughout the website. I used one font for the big catchy headings
          and another for the webpage content. This ended up contributing to the
          friendly and playful mood that the website gives off. For simplicity’s
          sake, I stuck with a maximum of two fonts to avoid overwhelming the
          user.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          This also creates a convention and adds to the hierarchy of
          information, users become used to seeing a big heading with a small
          sentence below it at first glance at the webpage. When they scroll
          down, then they see the webpages content.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I didn’t drastically change the layout of the website from assignment
          1. It is mostly the same but in assignment 3, I changed the font
          sizes, font types, backgrounds and content placing. This assignment,
          instead of focusing on a simple and straightforward design. I aimed
          for a creative, friendly and playful design. All webpages had a big
          heading, small sentence below it and a background below both these
          elements. After this point, the content placing changed depending on
          what the webpage was for but I used the convention, from assignment 1,
          of having content shown on top of a background colour.

        <h2 class="p-name">UI and UX</h2>
        <p class="e-content">
          Other UX and UI decisions include colour, font and negative space
          decisions but this has all been explained above.

        <p class="e-content">
          The navigation bar is centred towards the middle. The buttons are big
          and have no borders to make the edges look smooth and for it to blend
          with the button background colour. This makes it look smooth and is
          easy for the reader to look at.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          When the reader hovers above the navigation buttons, it enlarges and
          the colour changes. This increases the reader’s focus on the button
          and shows that it is interactable. This tells the reader that they can
          click on the button, in other words, that this is a point of
          interaction. However, this has not only been done for the navigation
          buttons, this functionality is also present for the buttons, to read a
          specific weekly blog, at the weekly blog webpage and when the reader
          want to click the scroll up button.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          Other points of interaction include certain text in a paragraph. Words
          that lead the reader to a certain part of the webpage are highlighted
          in a different colour and when the reader hovers above that word, the
          font increases. This is to make user flow easy. Instead of reading one
          big paragraph and then looking at the different choices of buttons to
          click on, it is easier for the reader to decided whether to click on a
          highlighted text from the paragraph they are already reading.
