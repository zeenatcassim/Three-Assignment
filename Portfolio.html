          I have written many stories over the years. If I include them here,
          this page would take forever to read. But here is a short story I
          wrote a while ago:
        </p>
        <p class="story">
          The house sat atop a cluster of hills buried on top of each other. It
          was hidden behind the folds of a great valley that grew luscious trees
          and hoisted a still lake. The waters were deep and dark but
          nonetheless, still and sleeping. Our house, our new house was an old
          Victorian mansion that existed since the 20th century. It was built by
          one of my father’s rich ancestor who held balls and hunting parties on
          these grounds but then he died and this old family heirloom got tossed
          down to the younger generations who thought it to be eerie and gloomy.
          This house sat empty and abandoned for a great number of years until
          we moved into it.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
          Our parents owned a famous company that supplied many things to the
          public. We were among the elite of the city. No one could say anything
          against us nor even touch a single hair strand on our heads. We were a
          family of seven. My parents, I and my four younger siblings. Rich,
          privileged and untouchable until my father got arrested for his money
          laundering and countless other crimes. We lost everything except for
          this house.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
          We’ve been here for a few weeks now. Cleaning the ancient walls,
          dusting cobwebs and living off scrapes. We are barely managing;
          there’s no money and our clothes are getting old. With each day, I
          grow wearier and tired. I can’t move as much as I used to do before. I
          can’t describe it but there is this feeling, exhaustion perhaps that
          sits in my bones and flows through my blood. It makes me weak; it
          makes me cry and it makes me want to sleep. But I can’t. I blink my
          sleep away as I march my way up the winding staircase. I have to hold
          onto the railing to steady myself because the stairs curve to the
          right and I tend to lose my balance on these narrow stairs. I’m afraid
          of falling here, the stairs are long and sharp on the edges. Someone
          could fall and hit their head.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
          My stomach grumbles as I step over the last stair and open the room to
          my door. It is ten at night and my fingers are rubbery from all the
          dishes I just washed. All I want to do is lie down in my bed and sleep
          but then I hear a thud coming from behind my closet door.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
          In a big and empty house, there are bound to be lot of noises. There
          are rats scurrying around, shelves falling down and windows banging
          open the whole time. I sleep in the tower room, situated on the east
          side, looming above the kitchen and dining area. I hear whispers and
          things falling down all the time but there’s nothing in my closet.
          Grumbling under my breath, I swing the door open and nothing happens.
          Not until I feel something fall down on my shoulder. It is feathery
          and soft, leaving a trail of goosebumps on my sweaty skin. I swat it
          off but the feeling runs down my back, then my legs and then my neck.
          What is this? What is happening? I turn to get to the door but my legs
          collapse and I fall down to the ground.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
          My throat gets itchy and this soft but light and feathery feeling runs
          all over my body. I try to scream but it enters my mouth. A loud
          pitter patter sound enters my ears. I try to move my hands but I
          can’t. It’s so tiring, so numb. I just feel like closing my eyes and
          sleeping. My eyes turn up and that’s when I see it. A large trail of
          spiders running up the walls and disappearing into a hole on the
          ceiling.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
          I try to cough but a choking sound escapes my throat. I want to move;
          I want to get out of here but my room gets more darker and colder. I
          left a light on my dressing table but it flickers off and I’m left to
          sleep in the darkness of my room.

          I can code games with unity c# and now I even code websites! I have
          only made two websites so far but I have made a lot of games, for
          class and in my own time. I have an account on itch.io, I haven't
          uploaded any of my games to it yet but heres the link to it
          <a href="https://whizzper.itch.io">https://whizzper.itch.io</a>. There
          isn't much to it but I plan on uploading my games on it soon.

          I haven't made a lot of digital drawings but I have made my own game
          assets. These are the assets for a card game I made last year:
