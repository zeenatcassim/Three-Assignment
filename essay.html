        In this essay, I am going to analyse the Takealot website and then
        discuss the ethics behind its interaction design. First, I am going to
        explain the concepts of interface and interaction before I present an
        explanation and then detailed analysis on the user interface and user
        experience of the Takealot website. This will be followed by a
        discussion about the user interface and experience and finally a
        conclusion to end this essay.
      </p>

      <p>
        All websites have an interface. The interface is a symbolic
        representation of interaction or it can be said that users are able to
        interact with a website through its interface. This is due to the fact
        that the interface is a platform to symbolize, express and make
        interaction possible for website users (Geyser 2023).
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, when website developers organise and display information on
        websites, they do it through its interface. However, because interaction
        with a website requires website users to take decisions in what they
        want to read or do next, developers need to design and plan the user
        interface and user experience wisely because these two factors have a
        huge impact on whether users interact successfully or unsuccessfully
        with a website (Geyser 2023).
      </p>

      <p>
        The user interface of a website is the visual elements or graphics
        present in the website that users are able to see and read (Geyser
        2023). Because if this, it is also the visual aspect of interactivity.
        Interactivity is also a system that conveys meaning, it is made up of
        interface elements that have two very important components to them; one,
        is how it looks and second, what does it do (Geyser 2023). Since the
        user interface is the visual aspect of websites, it is important that
        interface elements look like the action they are supposed to perform.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user interface is affected by factors such as visual structure, page
        layouts, colours, fonts, hierarchy and accessibility (Geyser 2023).
        These factors are what makes a website look attractive and appealing but
        these should also aim to strive for clarity, to make information
        accessible, easy to find, easy to read and easy to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user experience of a website are the evoked emotions websites users
        feel or experience when browsing through a website (Goldberg 2023).
        These emotions are based on how users feel when they see and interact or
        make decisions on websites. Also, these come from users and their
        response to the user interface of a website. If a certain font was
        chosen, then is it legible and readable for the user? If the website
        content is centred to the middle and then sideways, is the website
        balanced and aligned to the middle? Therefore, the design choices and
        visual elements from the user interface evokes a feeling in the user and
        this affects the user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the Takealot website, most content is situated towards the middle of
        the webpage. This space is divided into having a list of products on the
        right side that the user can scroll through and on the left side is a
        list of categories that the user can click on to see a list of products
        from there. This is the same for the homepage. A list of categories the
        user can look through is on the left side of the webpage while
        recommendations or adverts and more products are situated to the right
        but towards the bottom. However, at certain webpages, there are more
        advertisements on the right side of the page while the lists of products
        are moved towards the left side of the page. Thus, the viewer gaze moves
        from left to right then downwards and then from left to right again. The
        website uses square blocks to present available products on the website.
        These all have images to show what the product looks like, followed by a
        title, then the price, a heart icon on the top right corner to add the
        product to your wish list and extra information that shows if its on
        stock, where it gets shipped from and ratings. Lastly the square has a
        green button where users can add the product to their cart. This button
        has a hover function where the background gets filled and the text turns
        white. Although just hovering above the square block with the product
        changes the cursor which informs users that this is interactable and
        that they can click on it if they wish to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clicking on a product lets website users read extra information about
        the product, find recommendations based on the product, a description,
        more information on the product, followed by reviews and then more
        recommendation. This information all is presented in square blocks with
        white backgrounds. Normal text is either black or grey but the one’s
        that is interactable, the user can click to find more products or get
        answers for questions they might be having, is in blue and the cursor
        changes when users hover above it. Other interactable points users can
        click on are icons, are in the colour green, the cursor changes when
        hovering above it and some display extra information when the cursor
        hovers above it. The white squares stand out against the light grey
        background of the webpage, putting more emphasis on the list of
        recommended products. As stated above, most interaction points lets the
        cursor change its icon, has a hover function where the background gets
        filled and the text changes colour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, importantly users view text in blue but these are actually
        interactable points that lets the viewer navigate between other pages of
        the website. The website mainly uses the colours grey, blue, white and
        black. The website uses the convention of having interactable text in
        blue, important information highlighted in bold while normal text is
        grey. Due to the light grey and white backgrounds, the blue text or
        icons in blue, including other interaction points in colours like green
        or red, stand out even more. On the homepage, the navigation bar is
        actually viewed as a drop-down menu on the left side of the webpage. The
        heading has a dark grey background while the text is white but this
        isn’t interactable. The list below is text in grey but upon hovering
        above it, the background of the text turns to blue and a new panel
        appears next to the bar with most text that gives the user a more
        detailed list of categories they can click on and view the products in
        that specific category. Next to this is a search bar and below these are
        more options to click on to view more products to buy. Above this is the
        website logo and more text users can click on to view more information
        about Takealot or their account and more extra information such as what
        products they added to their cart or wish listed. The user interface and
        user experience of Takealot.com is easy and simple to read and
        understand. Content and information is centred towards the middle with
        each section next to each other but there is sufficient space between
        each one.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes it easy for the website user to read since there is space to
        rest their eyes on the webpage. It is also easy to view products and
        choose what to buy because they are appear as square blocks and have
        sufficient space between them to not overwhelm the user. Also, because
        these blocks have a light grey background, the information of the
        product stands out and easily catches the user’s attention. The button
        to add a product to your cart is at the button of this square block
        which works well to direct the viewer gaze and also logically works
        well. However, website users have a choice to decide how they want to
        view their products. Instead of viewing them in small blocks, next to
        each other. Users can decide if they want to view the website’s products
        as a list. With this, the product’s information is still confined to a
        square block but the difference is that users have to scroll down
        because each product appears below one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated above, the convention of using colours to suggest that a text
        is interactable is an efficient and understandable practice in the
        website that is consistently used. This works well because the website
        user becomes used to this and begins to expect to see this everywhere on
        the website. The Takealot website makes use of conventions website users
        already know of to effectively communicate the website’s interface to
        them. The website presents their products in the confines of a square
        block to present it in a coherent manner and to direct the viewer gaze
        in a logical direction. Also, the use of minimal colours with additions
        of bright blues around the websites gives it a cool and relaxed
        atmosphere. The addition of bright blue at certain places of the website
        helps to attract the user’s attention to deals or promotions happening.
        Therefore, with this reasoning, it can be deduced that the user
        interface and user experience of the Takealot website is simple but it
        effectively presents content and important information to website users.
        Due to this simple but effective visual structures, users are able to
        understand visual hierarchies and navigate their way to different
        webpages.
